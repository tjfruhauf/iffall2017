		Higher resolution pictures for spongebob and squidward images.
		<br>
		Change the background color scheme to the character's color scheme.
		<br>
		Center the characters.
		<br>
		The text could potentially chamge(also look at background images from the show).
		<br>
		Make sure the margins on each side balance one another.

		Feedback(Zihan)
		<br>
		How will the image be aligned to the text?
		<br>
		The text for the first postcard doesn't feel like shouting. How can you play with the font size and weight to capture the energy of the quote.
		<br>
		The color scheme for the second postcard makes the text less legiable. Make the back ground contrast the image more.
		<br>
		For the planet postcard there is a large sreen with losts of negative space. Perhaps space out the text throught the space to consider the pacing of the reader. 
		<br>
		For each quote see if the leading is working and things don't feel bunched together.
