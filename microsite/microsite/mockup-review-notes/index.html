	<h1> WORLD TRADE CENTER WEBSITE </h1>
	<p> For the home page <br> Have 3 images play like a mini slide show across the top screen. Possibly deop the headlines for each page. Or decrease the contrast of the head lines so that they blend well with the image. This can be done by drcreasing the opacity of the image and adjusting the color pallet to that of the image. Or if that doesn't work just take them out entirely. Make sure the text is left-align. The centered text make it akward and feel seperate from one another. To emphasize verticality, on the about page we will have the margins match that of the statement, with the images right and the text left. Try making the headers all caps and increasing he contrast by changing the colors. Rework the observatory layout, by having an image that shows the observatory and breaking up the text that talks about the observatory. Decrease the font size of the source page. I don't think it is neccessary to have the bibliography that long. Possibly add a button that will take you back to the home page. Contained in a bar at the bottom of the screen is a "back to top" option

	<h2> INCEPTION WEBSITE <h2>
	<p>
	The key to this website is making sure that the user knows how to navigate so that they are not going to click away from the website when they enter. Adding an icon or navigation arrow that brings them through the page will be very important. On each page there will be an arrow alluding to the depth of the dream levels. Having the image start quitier(cool colors) and then becoming more saturated and dramatic toward the end. Be ver light on the photoshop and let the image do most of the story telling. The text and logos on the bottom of the first image need to be taken out. Get rid of the box outline on the character spread. Also get rid of the image that is there and just have it be text. The typography needs ot change. I must finad a more sci-fi looking type with more geometic shape in the letter form and perhaps a thinner type setting. Dream Level one image will need to be toned down. Dream level 2 can be the dream level 3 image. Dream level 3 can be an image of the safe or inception scene. Keep the sources page the same just make sure to have a link back to the character page. Ther will be highlight points throughout the website to indicate to the viewer that there are some facts. 

	Primary focus 
	-image, text, and navigation.
