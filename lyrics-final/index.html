					<h5> MIAMI <br> 2017</h5>
					<p>INTRO
					<br>
					<br>
					I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
					<br>
					I saw the Empire State lay low
					<br>
					And life went on beyond Palisades
					<br>
					They all bought Cadillacs
					<br>
					And left there long ago
					</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>	VERSE
					<br>
					<br>
					We held a concert out in Brooklyn
					<br>
					To Watch the Island bridges blow
					<br>
					They turned our power down
					<br>
					And drove us underground
					<br>
					But we went right on with the show
					</p>

				<div class ="lyrics">
				<p>I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
				<br>
				I saw the ruins at my feet
				<br>
				You know we almost didn't notice it
				<br>
				We'd seen it all the time on 42nd Street
				<br>
				<br>
				They burned the churches up in Harlem
				<br>
				Like in that Spanish Civil War
				<br>
				The flames were everywhere
				<br>
				But no one really cared
				<br>
				It always burned up there before
				<br>
				<br>
				I've seen the lights go out on Broadway
				<br>
				I watched the mighty skyline fall
				<br>
				The boats were waiting at the Battery
				<br>
				The union went on strike
				<br>
				They never sailed at all
				<br>
				<br>
				They sent a carrier out from Norfolk
				<br>
				And picked the Yankees up for free
				<br>
				They said that Queens could stay
				<br>
				They blew the Bronx away
				<br>
				And sank Manhattan out at sea
<br>
	<br>		
				You know those lights were bright on Broadway
				<br>
				But that was so many years ago
				<br>
				Before we all lived here in Florida
				<br>
				Before the mafia took over Mexico
				<br>
				There are not many who remember
				<br>
				They say a handful still survive
				<br>
				To tell the world about
				<br>
				The way the lights went out
				<br>
				And keep the memory alive
				</p>
